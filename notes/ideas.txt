Add an Identifier for the wallet to be publicly shamed but also could use for off chain Identifier.

I could mint a token to the wallet ERC721 would be the ideal. Non transferrable. This NFT could hold more of the string information. 

Problem with adding URI atm is string's are expensive to store on chain. 
By keeping the minimum amount of data stored on chain, gas costs should be as low as possible

Mint NFT with metadata which can be updated with important information.
